# Nasa Image of the Day
My first exercise fetching data from an API and populating the DOM utilizing javascript with fetched data. 

## Instructions for assignment
One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. Your task is to create a page that shares the image along with relevant information to the world. 

 ðŸš€ For this practice, you can use the demo API key from NASA however it does have limits on number of requests. You may also sign up for your own API key.

#### Planning
* Review data
* Wireframe
* What modules will you create?
* Stretch Goal: once you get the photo of the day displaying you next challenge is to display the image related to your birthday.
